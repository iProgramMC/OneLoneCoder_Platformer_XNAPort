# OneLoneCoder Platformer XNA Port
A port in C# with the XNA Game Framework of OneLoneCoder's (javidx9's) platformer engine.
This engine can also work with Monogame, which is a more "universal" XNA
implementation.

This program is protected under the MIT license now, as I feel it deserves a bit more freedom.

Hello! Ultimately I don't care what you use this for. It's intended to be
educational, and perhaps to the oddly minded - a little bit of fun.
Please hack this, change it and use it in any way you see fit. You acknowledge
that I am not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of
your actions. However this code is protected by GNU GPLv3, see the license in the
github repo. This means you must attribute me if you use it. You can view this

Cheers!


Background
~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
Tile maps are fundamental to most 2D games. This program explores emulating a classic 2D platformer
using floating point truncation to implement robust collision between a moving tile and a tilemap
representing the level.

Controls
~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~
Left and Right arrow keys move Jario, Space bar jumps.
(Up and Down also move jario)
